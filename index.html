          My name is Sarah Thevenot and I am currently enrolled in University of
          Denver's Coding Bootcamp. I graduated high school in 2020 and am
          recently unemployed trying to pursue my education and start a career
          as a web developer. I really enjoy building and designing websites
          and can't wait to keep learning and growing throughout this course.
          I previously was an employee at Jersey Mike's subs and worked my way up
          to assistant manager before I turned 19. I look forward to starting my
          career and making the most of my life!
