# My Portfolio Module 2


This is a portfolio project focused on HTML and CSS. The goal was to create an application to showcase your talents as a developer for potential employers. 

Some of the criteria involved an active navigation bar, a way to contact me, and images that display some of the websites I've built so far, as well as some information about me.
